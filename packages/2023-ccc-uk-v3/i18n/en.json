After a brief recovery, he started walking regularly with 9-kilogram bulletproof vest equipped with level-four armored plates for four to five kilometers every day to regain stamina. Just three months after his surgery, he embarked on another journey to Ukraine, neither death nor artillery could deter his passion for capturing reality and reporting the truth.\n This is a unique journey, as he had just confronted his personal battle within his own flesh, then immediately arrived at the fiercest war-torn Eastern Ukraine to document the ongoing conflict. Through his lens, we witness Ukrainian soldiers, after enduring a year-long arduous struggle, quietly launching a counteroffensive. Amidst the cacophony of battle and swirling dust, we see residents who would rather endure life among the ruins, without water or electricity, than abandon their homeland.\n\nThis is a somber scene of historical significance. He takes us along to observe and prompts us to comtemplate on Taiwan's own situation.","pairs":[{"head":"Resistance","body":"When the surgical ward slides open at National Taiwan University Hospital, a cold clinical air swooshes, and everything inside looks and smells sanitarily clean and calm under the cacophony of fluorescent lights. From my wheelchair, I can see the robot-assisted arms of the Da Vinci surgical system, which Dr. Huang, one of the best urologists in the country, and his team will use to perform my prostatectomy. I asked a uniformed staffer if I could play Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries during the surgery; she grinned but hinted I could only listen to it before entering the ward. Once the anesthesia was injected, I was out within seconds. Six hours later, I was in my hospital bed in excruciating pain. Behind me, on the wall, were pictures of my kids in Austria and their drawings with colorful hearts and get-well-soon letters.\n\nI looked at the multiple bloody scars across my numb, swollen stomach with disbelief. To ease the agonizing pain, an IV pole with a small dose of morphine stood next to my bed. When I reached my pain threshold, I would squeeze the button. Then I had to wait ten minutes for the next fix, no matter how tortured I felt!\n\nOccasionally, patients moaned, and nurses pushed carts across the hall. Otherwise the night was dreadfully still but for the tick of the second hand of the clock on the wall, each echoing louder than the one before. I stuffed my ears with wet tissues, knocked myself out with another fix of painkiller. In the wee hours of the morning, I woke up after coughing and there was a sharp, stabbing sensation on my belly. It was March 4. On the same day in 2022, the year before, I had arrived in Ukraine to document the invasion of Ukraine, an innocent landscape despoiled by Russia. I wished I were there now.\n\nTwo months after surgery and recovery, I finally returned to Graz, Austria, where I have lived since getting married and becoming a parent, to make up for the lost time with my kids. In addition, I gradually exercised to regain stamina. Despite reminders from my doctors and fellow prostate cancer survivors not to carry heavy stuff over three kilos, I walked regularly with a bulletproof vest equipped with level-four armored plates. That’s about nine kilos. Finally, with “fit-to-travel” permission from my urologist in Austria, I arrived in Kyiv on June 4.\n\nThe first Sunday of June in the capital was bright and blue even though it had been under attack from ballistic cruise missiles and Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones. My friend who saw the Patriot air defense system intercepting the incoming missiles warned me not to take pictures of intercepts. One day in May, thirty-two individuals who posted pictures or videos of the Patriot intercepting Russian missiles on social media, were arrested. They were forced to make confessions and apologies on TV and on the social media site Telegram with their faces blurred. \n\nThe country has been living with a palpable sense of tension and unease since the Russia’s full-scaled invasion in February 2022. Under martial law, heightened security measures and constant vigilance are everywhere. Any slight suspicious move will be reported and investigated by the Ukraine State’s Secret Services (SBU.) I know that for a fact!\n\nBack in the late afternoon of March 2022, I heard a high-pitched, piercing whistle moving in the air towards me. The swoosh became higher in pitch. I looked up and it was an eight-meter Kalibr cruise missile. Then another one, both whizzing over my head, the sound died down as it receded, and then seconds later, they struck an oil depot outside the city. The rumbling explosions thumped the earth as an impenetrable mushroom cloud billowed into the air. The wind carried it further spread, darkened and suffocated the beautiful historical city of Lviv. Meanwhile, fire engines and police vehicles, wailing, converged on the engulfed depot. I rushed up to a nearby hilltop of the landmark Lychakiv Cemetery to take pictures. \n\nAs I held my breath and looked through the viewfinder, I could also sense in my peripheral vision that onlookers were sizing me up suspiciously. Before I knew what was happening, a man in his mid-30s with a black baseball cap ran up the hill. Then another two men, in dark windbreakers, black jeans, baseball caps and sling pouches, hurried up. In less than a minute, I was boxed in! I raised both arms but the first order was turn around with both hands on the guard rails and remain absolutely still. I could see something protruding from one of the men’s lower right windbreaker pocket. It’s probably either a walkie-talkie or a pistol, I thought. An hour-long body search examined every pore and between my every finger and toe. Every picture and all the phone records, including WhatsApp, Telegram and Messenger from the previous hours and days were questioned and verified: “Who is Marta? Girlfriend?” “No.” “Who is Igor, is he Russian?” “A photographer friend from Kharkiv.” “Why are you keeping receipts? Are you CIA?” “No!” “Mossad?” “No!”\n\nIt was getting dark and chilly. I was finally allowed to put on my socks upon the somewhat satisfactory completion of the interrogation. As I looked around, all the onlookers had already disappeared. It was just me and three baseball-capped, dark-clothed men, all with identical hair-cuts. There was still audible murmuring and the blaring and wailing far away. \n\nI might have been perceived as an informer taking pictures and providing coordinates for Russia. Being cooperative as I was searched and truthfully answering every question, was my only  chance to prove my innocence. I later related the event to a friend with NATO, and he said I was lucky to have an Asian face, or I could have been mopped on the ground before questioning! I hurried back to my hotel just before the curfew started, had a shot of leftover Polish vodka from Krakow and phoned up my fixer—who supposedly was smoothing my way—with one sentence: “You’re fired.”\n\nThis latest was my fifth trip to Ukraine since the invasion. My only objective in Kyiv was to catch up with colleagues over beer and to pick up my new press credential. I was planning to leave for Donbas the next day. Then I realized that the accreditation application from my agency, Magnum Photos in Paris, to the Ukraine Ministry of Defense (MOD) in Kyiv had been lost in the digital abyss. A major hiccup! I had no choice but to reapply right there and right away. I was told that there were a thousand-plus applicants ahead of me all queuing up for approval. And I was further told that it’s an “immovable process” that requires three to four weeks. It’s not up to the MOD but the SBU for the final approval. I cannot clarify how I jumped the line to get my press card. I am forever grateful to friends in high places for expediting the process!\n\nIt was a smooth drive from Kyiv to Dnipro via Highway M03 with my fixer, Evhen; no air alerts and no checkpoints. But once we were headed towards Pokrovsk in Donbas, drab olive-green military vehicles were zooming by in both directions. We slowed down and stopped at checkpoints newly-reinforced with concrete blocks. More often than not, when a policeman with a Kalashnikov rifle checked my passport and press card, my fixer would joke, “Jackie Chan!” And that often was an immediate ice breaker with grins and laughter. With my right fist clenched, I would respond by saying, “Jackie Chan stands with Ukraine,” although I do not think that Jackie Chan would ever have the gall to say that. Not in this life!\n\nThe war's impact on life in Ukraine is just as incomprehensible as it is lasting. Since the illegal and immoral invasion, every Ukrainian has families and friends fighting in the war as well as displaced, domestically or overseas. Ukraine will face gigantic problems after the war. But for now, the main goal is to win the war and to liberate the land that belongs to Ukraine. \n\nThe long-anticipated counteroffensive has been silently and cautiously under way on the eastern and southern fronts to puncture Russia’s defenses. Russia had spent months fortifying their lines with anti-tank ditches, vast minefields, concrete “dragon’s teeth,” iron “hedgehogs,” intricate infantry trenches, barbed-wired fences and artillery. Every square meter gained will require a slow and grinding battle. \n\nUkraine will need time, will, lives and a lot of firepower to launch a full-scale counteroffensive. I was with the 59th brigade artillery unit equipped with GRAD, a multiple rocket launcher system. Some forty rockets were loaded on the truck with four soldiers standing by, all camouflaged in the woods, ready for the firing order from the command center. Once a target had been confirmed, they would drive to the position, adjust the coordinates and fire within minutes. The commander would confirm whether the target had been hit or not. Then another two or three rockets could be fired before they swiftly relocated under another tree line lest they too be targeted and take return fire. It’s all “shoot and scoot,” but also to conserve ammo. I was quite near the firing rockets, and so, not just the sound, but the shock wave penetrated my body. I covered my ears and kept my mouth open to balance the pressure.\n\nWe were all told to switch our phones to Airplane mode before reaching front line positions. The only connection was via Starlink. A soldier from the 72nd brigade told me that the Russian soldiers were just behind the tree line about a kilometer away from where we stood. We were on the so-called Zero Line. As we moved around a dark, damp, dense and mazelike trench, it was more than clear: “If you want to live, dig!” The soldiers in the trenches are to hold the position with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, AK rifles and Javelins, no matter what!"}]},"caption":"Photo / Magnum Photos, 2023","credit":{"pairs":["Text by: Chien-Chi Chang","Photo by: Chien-Chi Chang / Magnum Photos","Photo Editing: Hsin-Chan Chien","English Translation: Yueh-Ju Hsu","English Proofreading: Chien-Chi Chang"]}}}]
